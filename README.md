This is a simple browser-based Journal Entry web app built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 
It allows users to write, save and delete personal journal entries directly in the browser using localStorage, so entries persist even after refreshing or closing the tab.

Note: This project was created primarily for personal learning and practice â€” to get more hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage in native JavaScript.

Features :
- Add journal entries with a title, date, and content
